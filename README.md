# Yutils

This is the command line user interface helper program for the Yaa programming language
It is the best way to do a number of things related to Yaa, such as

1. Create a new Yaa project
2. Check if there is working JDK installed on the user's local machine
3. Check the version of the Yaa compiler
4. Check if Yaa is actually installed and visible to other programs

More functionality will be added to it as the project and its associated ecosystem matures
